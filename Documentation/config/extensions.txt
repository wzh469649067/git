extensions.objectFormat::
	Specify the hash algorithm to use.  The acceptable values are `sha1` and
	`sha256`.  If not specified, `sha1` is assumed.  As with other keys under
	the `extensions` hierarchy, this value is ignored and has no effect unless
	`core.repositoryformatversion` is 1.

Note that this setting should only be set by linkgit:git-init[1] or
linkgit:git-clone[1].  Trying to change it after initialization will not
work and will produce hard-to-diagnose issues.
